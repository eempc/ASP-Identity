Cardinal rule

If you intend to make a web app and storing user info with additional fields in the web app (i.e. not utilising google or facebook login), then do not ever use the creation wizard's Add Authorisation. Take the time to scaffold and add the identity manually. This will avoid the conflict between ApplicationDbContext which is generated by the wizard and the WebApplication1Context generated by the manual method.

Step 1 is to create a standard Razor web app (non-MVC, non-SPA) without authorisation
Step 2 is to right-click project and add Identity Scaffold, the options to tick are: Account/Register and Account/Manage/Index, it might just be Account/Manage though
Step 3 is to create the new Data context class and the new user class, (no need to modify the layout file) then Add
Step 4 is to migrate and update the newly generated database context
Step 5 Add app.UseAthentication(); to Startup.cs
Step 6 Add <partial name="_LoginPartial" /> to the header of the layout file
Step 7 is to go to your user model, e.g. WebApplicationUser.cs
Step 8 is to add [PersonalData] properties
Step 9 is to update the razor pages and associated cs files

Manage/Index.cshtml changes required:
- Add properties to InputModels within the constructor, LoadAsync (not GetAsync), PostAsync - will have to refer to the document for this one, will mark the new stuff with asterisks

Register.cshtml changes required:
--Add properties to InputModels within the constructor, and onPostAsync

Step 10 is to build then migrate
